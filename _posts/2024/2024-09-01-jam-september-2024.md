With our 30th collaboration, the [libGDX Jam](/community/jams/) continues the time-honoured tradition of making awesome games using the best framework out there. We encourage camaraderie, teamwork, and good sportsmanship with a side of well-intentioned buffoonery. The general jam rules can as always be found [here](/community/jams/#rules). **To participate take a look at the official [itch.io page of the jam](https://itch.io/jam/libgdx-jam-30).** The humorous jam trailer can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGF44yOH1xk).

Be sure to get involved with the community by joining the libGDX Discord server!
